      # mdMustache preprocessor

      I love MDSvex, a Svelte preprocessor that
      lets me put Svelte components directly into my
      markdown.

      Sometimes, when I'm stuck in anothere project and
      I _have_ to write some quick copy into plain `.svelte` files,
      I'm so sad.

      It turns out, I wanted the __opposite__ of MdSvex.
      What I wanted was to just throw some Markdown in my Svelte,
      not Svelte in my Markdown.

      Enter `some project name`.

      Use `remark` and friends to
      take the `{#md}`sequence
      and transform to rendered html.
